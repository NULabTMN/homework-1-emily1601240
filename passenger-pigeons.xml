	<text>A PLEA FOR
WILD PIGEONS
For Protection Against
' Wanton Slaughter
A Few Facts Concerning
Their Names and Migrat
ing Habits.
To the Editor of The Republican, sir:
Now that the northern flight of the
wild "doves" and "white winas" has
begun, may I be permitted to offer a
few remarks pertinent to this kind of
game, more particularly in favor of
its protection against complete exter
mination? Having been taught, from
earlv boyhood, to tram; over hill and
dale in cuest if game. I was always
admonished never to bag tnore game
than was actually needed.
Judging from this standpoint you
will readily understand why I take
such interest in this matter. Accord
ing to my method of reasoning the wild
pigeon needs as yiueh protection as the
wild duck, the wild turkey, or deer,
quail, grouse, prairie chicken, etc.
Cannot a law be enacted limiting the
bagging of this kind of game to fifty
birds per day for each person, or some
tiling similar to the law relating to
quail, so that the game butchers may
be prevented from doing such wanton
slaughter? Why not limit the shoot
ing of wild pigeons from April 15th to
August 1.1th, and make the closed sea
son from August 16th of one vear to
April 14th of the next year following?
Likewise preventing the sale or barter
of such came? Let us be true sports
men and not wholesale pot-hunters or
hogs. The practice of hunters killing
from two hundred to six hundred wild
pigeons in one day appears to me to
be unreal and inhuman, tending rather
to encourage others to excel in this
needless killing of birds. This is not
true sport. I call it plain, downright
d.-.-tructiveness. or murder! The fair
minded sportsman satisfies himself
with winging a bountiful number of
birds, and does not shoot for the sake
f seeing how many he can get at one
tand.
I venture to assert that if the whole
sale slaughter of these wild pigeons
oi-tinues so unmercifully for the next
f'-w years as has been done in the past,
;il, bearing in mind that the number
of hunters increases each successive
year in - equal proportion, they will
have become almost extinct within the
next forty to fifty years, or perhaps
e-irliei. and then tilere will be a repe
lion'of e--.o t!y the same conditions as
thry now exist in the central and
astern states, namely, a woeful scare-
ity of these birds, brought about
through utter jieglect in failing to pro
vide for their protection. Let us take
warning from the experiences of our
eastern neighbors. It is a lamentable
fact that the eastern states had but
few game laws previous to the year
1ST6. hence the scarcity of "furs, fins
and feathers" in those sections. Then
let us, while the opportunity presents
itself, protect this feathered tribe. I
call upon that true and gentlemanly
sportsman. Captain Crenshaw, prese
senting the territorial legislature from
this county, to interest himself in be
half of this humane raise.
The lessons taught nie in my youth
have always stood me in good stead.
Only once, however, did 1 break tl
game laws. This incident happened
away up in Aroostook county. Maine,
in November. 1S7S, at a time when
large game in thiit region was decid
edly much more plentiful than it is at
the present time. The laws but then
recently enacted, allowed the killing
of one moose, or deer, per day to each
num. There were five in our party,
including our old friend, guide and
trapper. Joe Murphy, from Kangor,
since deceased, whose fame as a stalk
er was world-wide. It appeared that
the moose all came my way. and 1 des
patched them in their order of appear
ance, since no one in our party had
succeeded in getting within good range
for the desired results. The third an
imal, however, played "possum on me.
While in the act of using my 8-inch
bowie (the 44-inch rifle standing
against a tree some ten feet distant)
the bull moose jumped up between me
and the rifle and charged against me.
My only protection lay in making for
the nearest pine tree. The 'wounded
animal then wedged its antlers against
that tree, finally extricating itself, and
moving hurriedly in the opposite di
rection from that in which it came.
Remember please, that magazine rifles
were not generally in use during those
davs and that the time consumed in
running for that sun and re-loading it
was one of the quickest .acts of my
life. The second attempt., to tip jnv
X-incii bowie proved more successful
than the first. Tr-e hunt on that day
w.is continued until late in the after
noon, when it again became my good
fortune to ,'iiqtroac'i within shooting
range of the fourth animal, which I
brought down by hitting in the upper
left hand shoulder, -penetrating into
the vital region of its heart.. Having
been ignorant of the law relating to
the shooting of moose, I very incau
tiously Informed the game warden that
1 had secured the four moose and was
taken into custody. I was however
Immediately released upon my own
recognizance and through the inter
vention of legal and official friends,
by the payment of a nominal tine, and
returned homeward bound. Our guide.
Murphy, knew the law and had intend
ed asking me to divide up the game
equally among our party, thus avoid
ing detection, but the game warden
arrived in our midst before he had
that opportunity. We were a'owed to
take the game. Kver since that occur
rence I have always faithfully observed
and respected the game laws of the
localities in which I hunted.
It is scarcely needless to state that
I am and always shall be. in favor of
protecting our wild game to the fullest
extent of the law.
Why the local hunters persist in call
ing these birds wild "doves" or "white
wings" is beyond the ken of the ornith
ologist. . They are called passenger
pigeons (ectopistes migratorious of the
family Columbidae) or wild pigeon.
There are upward of three hundred
birds of this order that are listed, but
only twelve species are found in North
America. The wild pigeon migrates
north from Brazil and Central Ameri
ca to Montana, Washington and Ore
gon, or thereabouts, and thence south
ward again to near the equator, with
the seasons, always following the
warn zones. It breeds late in, the win
ter or early in spring, in far osuthern
latitudes, . and w hen the young are
strong enough for distant flight, the
litigatory Instinct asserts Itself late in
March and early in April, preserving
the In migrations northward in large
numbers, feeding all the while, until
late in August, when the southern
flight begins. They do not remain
long in one place when returning.
There are also a few stragglers that
remain in this 'latitude during the
winter .'norths.
The wild pigeon is about twelve to
fourteen inches in length. The male
has upper parts bluish slate, shaded
with olive gray on its back and shoul
ders, metallic violet, gold and green
ish reflections on the back and sides
of its head. The wing covets with vel
vety black spots, throat bluish slate,
quickly shading into a rich reddish
buff on breast, and paling into white
underneath; the middle tail feathers
are black, fading from pearlish into
white. Th" female possesses the Maine
characteristics, except that the upper
parts are washed with more olive
brown: has less frrcdeseence; breast
pale grayish brown fading to white
underneath. The "white wing" of the
family Columbidae bears a striking re
semblance to the male members of
ectopistes, although of a slightly dif
ferent species. It is a male bird, hav
ing a baud of white along its tail
feathers and several white feathers in
its wings, hence the term "white
wings." It is a larger bird than those
previously described, and appears
little later in the season ill this lati
tude than the others.
A noted ornithologist has truly said:
"Vhe modern mind, accustomed to deal
ty with pitfiTrf-reinnarrrs of feathered
races can scarcely grasp the vast num
bers of these birds that once made our
land the sportsman'-s paradise. Unlim
ited' netting has resulted in sending
over one million pigeons to market
from a, single roost in one year, leaving
perhaps as many more wounded birds
and starving almost helpless squabs
behind, until the poultry stalls became
so glutted with pigeons that the low
price per barrel scarcely paid for their
transportation, and they were fed to
the hogs. This abominable practice of
netting and promiscuous killing of
wild pigeons discontinued only because
there were no other flocks left to cap
ture or It:!!, and the few remaining
birds were driven to farther southerly
latitudes to change their habits and
live chiefly in couples. The extermin
ation of the passenger pigeon has pro
gressed so rapidly that it has become
as scarce as the great auk along the
coasts."
There is a vast difference between the
passenger pigeon and the small mourn
ing dove (zenaidura niacroura) seen
in this latitude from March to Novem
ber. The band-tailed or whilecollared
pigeon (Columba fasciata) is mostly
confined to the mountainous regions,
when acorns are abundant. It is of
the same size as the domestic pigeon.
